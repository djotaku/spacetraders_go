Go code to interact with the Space Traders API

I just learned about this neat API-based video game called [Space Traders](https://spacetraders.io). It seems kind of like EVE Online, but built with the API as a first-class citizen. Using the API to automate your tasks isn't cheating - it's encouraged!

It's an interesting concept where the userbase makes the UIs for the game and players are free to make their own or use someone else's. (Hopefully the API doesn't eventually go the way of Twitter or Reddit)

I'm going to use this project to learn how to create GUIs with Go. I usually create UIs with Qt, but the Go bindings seem really annoying to use. So I'm going to learn how to use [Fyne](https://fyne.io), one of the most recommended UIs for Go.

Although UIs should be done after planning, this game is so new (and evolving) that the UI will probably evolve as I understand what it is I would like it to do and how it would be most useful to me.

Finally, I will also have some automation "scripts" in this repo as well. I imagine I'll have a GUI screen to launch various scripts to do certain things. It's all up in the air and I hope to have some fun.
